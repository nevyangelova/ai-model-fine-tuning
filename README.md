# AI Model Fine-Tuning Platform

This is a Next.js application for managing AI model fine-tuning jobs. The platform allows users to create, monitor, and delete fine-tuning jobs for AI models.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technical Architecture & Design Decisions

### UI Framework: Material UI

I chose Material UI for this project for several key reasons:

- **Development Speed**: Having extensive experience with MUI, it allowed me to build complex UI components quickly without reinventing the wheel.
- **Component Ecosystem**: MUI provides a rich set of accessible, responsive components that work well together and follow consistent patterns.
- **Theming & Customization**: While using a component library has some styling limitations compared to custom CSS, MUI's theming system still provides sufficient flexibility for most use cases.

**Trade-offs**: While MUI accelerated development, it did introduce some limitations in terms of styling flexibility and bundle size. In a more mature version of the application, I would consider transitioning to CSS Modules for better performance and more precise styling.

### State Management

#### React Query for Server State

I implemented React Query for data fetching and server state management because:

- **Separation of Concerns**: It cleanly separates server state from client state
- **Caching & Background Updates**: Provides automatic caching and background refetching
- **Loading/Error States**: Standardized loading, error, and success states
- **Mutations & Optimistic Updates**: Simplified API for mutations with rollbacks
- **Prefetching**: Supports data prefetching for faster user experiences

#### Form Context for Multi-step Forms

I added a Form Context using React Context API for the multi-step form process:

- **Centralized Form State**: Maintains form data across multiple steps
- **Validation Integration**: Connects form state directly with validation logic
- **Navigation Control**: Handles step-to-step navigation with validation checks
- **Reusability**: Makes form components reusable

### API Architecture

The API service layer is structured to:

- **Abstract API Details**: Encapsulates endpoint URLs, authentication, and request/response handling
- **Type Safety**: Provides strongly typed responses and request payloads
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling across all API calls
- **Reusability**: Query and mutation hooks that can be used throughout the application
- **Separation**: Clear separation between data fetching logic and UI components

### Form Validation

I implemented Zod for form validation because:

- **Type Safety**: It provides runtime validation with TypeScript integration
- **Schema Definition**: Allows for clear, declarative schema definitions
- **Complex Validations**: Supports complex, interdependent field validations
- **Error Messages**: Customizable error messages with field-specific context
- **Performance**: Lightweight and efficient validation processing

### Performance Optimizations

The application includes several performance optimizations:

- **Server Components**: Using Next.js App Router to leverage server components for initial rendering
- **Client/Server Separation**: Clear boundaries between server and client components
- **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Using React Query's SWR pattern for data freshness
- **Component Structure**: Carefully structured components to minimize re-renders
- **Code Splitting**: Leveraging Next.js automatic code splitting for route-based chunking

### Project Structure

The project follows a feature-based organization:

- `/components`: UI components organized by feature/domain
  - `/dashboard`: Dashboard-specific components
  - `/form`: Form and wizard components
  - `/ui`: Shared UI components
- `/contexts`: React context providers
- `/services`: API and service layer
- `/utils`: Utility functions and helpers
- `/app`: Next.js App Router pages and layouts

This structure was chosen to promote:
- **Discoverability**: Related code is grouped together
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without disrupting existing code
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities
